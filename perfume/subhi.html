        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Fragrances can be classified on the basis of the concentration of their ingredients, which in turn affects how strong they are and how long they last. The more the proportion of perfume oils as opposed to alcohol, the more the concentration. So a full-fledged ‘Parfum’ will have the most longevity, with anywhere between 15 to 40 percent concentration. Most parfums though will contain around 20 to 30 percent. These tend to be the most expensive, although they are the most effective, and are also better for people who are prone to allergic reactions since the alcohol content is lower. Next in line is the Eau de Parfum (EDP), which typically lasts around five hours, and contains a concentration of 15 to 20 percent. This is the most commonly used in the market because it is moderate in both cost and efficacy. The third highest concentration is seen in the Eau de Toilet (EDT) – around 5 to 15 percent. It is ideal for a day or a work scent because it is cost-effective and not overpowering. Lastly, the Eau de Cologne (EDC) with a very low concentration (2 to 4 percent) and mild fragrance, comes in big bottles and needs .
